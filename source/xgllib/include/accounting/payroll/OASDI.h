/** @defgroup OSADI The Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program (OASDI) tax
 * \brief The Social Security Taxes
 * 
 * The OASDI tax -- more commonly called the Social Security Tax began in 1937. At that 
 * time, the employee rate was 1%. It has steadily risen over the years, reaching 3% in 
 * 1960 and 5% in 1978. In 1990, the employee portion increased from 6.06 to 6.2% 
 * but has held steady ever sinceâ€”with the exception of 2011 and 2012.
 *
 * The Social Security Tax aggregates:
 * 
 * - The employee's calculated tax which is witheld from a paycheck; and
 * - The employer's calculated tax with is paid; and 
 * - a tax cap defining the maximum annual employee contribution.
 * 
 * The tax cap has existed since the inception of the program in 1937 and 
 * remained at $3,000 until the Social Security Amendments Act of 1950.1. It was 
 * then raised to $3,600 with expanded benefits and coverage. Additional increases 
 * in the tax cap in 1955, 1959, and 1965 were designed to address the difference 
 * in benefits between low-wage and high-wage earners.
