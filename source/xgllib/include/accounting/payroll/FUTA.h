    /** @defgroup FUTA Federal Unemployment Tax
    * \brief Employer's FUTA tax liability
    * 
    * The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a payroll tax paid by employers on employee wages. 
    * The tax is 6.0% on the first $7,000 an employee earns; any earnings beyond $7,000 are not taxed. 
    * In practice, the actual percentage paid is usually 0.6%. FUTA requires that employers contribute 
    * to the federal unemployment pool which covers employees who qualify for unemployment benefits. 
    * If you have at least one employee who works at least 20 weeks out of the year or have paid 
    * employees at least $1,500 in any quarter, you are responsible for paying FUTA taxes.
    * 
    * The magic number is $7,000. If you are required to pay FUTA based on the criteria above, the 
    * amount you are responsible for paying equals 6% of the first $7,000 your employee makes each calendar 
    * year. After you pay on that, anything earned after $7,000 does not need to account for FUTA.
    * 
    * FUTA Tax Credit. Raise your hand if you like tax credits. The good news is, if you pay SUTA (State 
    * Unemployment Tax Act) on time, you are eligible for a FUTA tax credit. This credit can be up to 5.4%, 
    * meaning your FUTA liability is 0.6%.
    * 
    * Payments are due quarterly. In the tax world, itâ€™s common to have quarterly tax deadlines. The same 
    * applies for FUTA with deadlines of: April 30th, July 31st, October 31st and January 31st. Make 
    * sure you pay on time or else you could face a penalty between 2% and 15%.
    * 
    * Employees do not pay FUTA. There are some payroll taxes that employees contribute to, like Social 
    * Security and Medicare taxes but FUTA is one that the sole responsibility falls on the employer.
